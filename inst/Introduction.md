This application is an example of how using R you can automatically generate power point presentations based on predefined templates and an Excel.

Currently, the traditional way of doing this is through VBA language. However, for many people this language is not very friendly and they prefer to learn others like Python or R, which is also much more useful for issues such as Machine Learning, Big Data,... Something that definitely VBA is not useful for us. R also offers much more flexibility.

In my professional career as a consultant, I have found situations in which slides had to be made massively from a predefined prototype. And in the same way, I have seen clients where periodically they had to make reports where a lot of time was invested in simply copying and pasting (with the risks of error that this implies).

A recommendation for any project is to structure the information as much as possible at the beginning of the project. The more structured it is, the more it can be exploited. And the best way to structure the information is in tables and this is where Excel can be very useful. From these perfectly structured tables, with R you can do everything imaginable. 

Thanks to the automation of slides we can save a considerable amount of time which, in addition, for those of us who have found ourselves in these situations, can be somewhat frustrating or even annoying.

As I said, thanks to the good structuring of the information, we can generate, through R, tables or graphics. For example, if we have a set of tasks with a number of associated days, we can generate a project calendar. Or if each initiative has a complexity and priority value, we can generate an action priority matrix.
