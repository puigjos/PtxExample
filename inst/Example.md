The chosen example is from a typical consultancy case which is a GAP analysis and initiative plan.

A gap analysis consists of finding weaknesses, deficiencies or failures that a company has. It generally focuses on processes, tools or ways of working that can be improved. In a gap analysis a series of gaps are identified and these have an impact on one or several areas and are usually accompanied by some metrics such as the impact on the company. 

From this analysis a project plan is usually built, that is, identifying a set of initiatives that will somehow solve all or part of the identified gaps. Each initiative is associated with a set of tasks and these, some departments involved and an estimated time of execution.

As can be seen, there are many interrelated elements that must be taken into account and that, structured in an intelligent way, we can save a lot of time
